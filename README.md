# numenera

Numenera Character Utility

A utility for manually creating and maintaining characters for the Numenera RPG.

## Usage

Run `lein run new` to start with a new character.

Run `lein run filename` to load an edn located in the resources directory.

## The Future

1. Finalize the basics of character creation and maintenance from the command-line;
2. Add a Numenera-specific dice roller; and,
3. A ClojureScript-fueled n-tier web application.
